# AdminDashboard Documentation

## Overview

**File:** `lib/screens/admin_dashboard.dart`

The `AdminDashboard` component serves as the main control panel for administrators in the Zaim University Campus Information System. It provides a centralized interface for navigating to various administrative functions and displays a high-level overview of key system entities.

## Class Structure

### AdminDashboard (StatefulWidget)

A stateful widget that serves as the entry point for the administrator dashboard.

**Properties:**
- None - The AdminDashboard takes no explicit parameters.

### _AdminDashboardState (State)

The state class that manages the dashboard data and UI.

**Properties:**
- `_authService`: Instance of AuthService for authentication-related operations.
- `_adminName`: String to display the current administrator's name, defaults to 'Administrator'.

## Key Methods

### initState()
- Initializes the component state.
- Calls `_loadAdminData()` to retrieve the administrator's profile information.

### _loadAdminData()
- Asynchronous method that fetches the current user's information.
- Updates the `_adminName` state variable with the administrator's name.
- Uses state mounting checks to prevent updating unmounted widgets.

### _handleLogout()

- Calls the authentication service's logout method.
- Redirects to the login screen upon successful logout.
