# Student Service Documentation

## Overview
**File:** `lib/services/student_service.dart`

The StudentService is an abstract class that defines the contract for student management operations. It extends the UserService to provide additional functionality specific to student profiles, including academic information, enrollment status, and student-specific preferences.

## Dependencies
- `user_service.dart`: Inherits user management functionality
- `models/student.dart`: Student model for type safety
- `models/academic_record.dart`: Academic record model
- `models/enrollment.dart`: Enrollment model

## Core Functionality

### Methods

#### Student Profile Operations
```dart
Future<Student> createStudent(Student student)
Future<Student?> getStudentById(String studentId)
Future<Student> updateStudent(Student student)
Future<void> deleteStudent(String studentId)
```
- CRUD operations for student profiles
- Extends user profile functionality
- Manages student-specific data
- Ensures data integrity

#### Academic Records
```dart
Future<AcademicRecord> getAcademicRecord(String studentId)
Future<AcademicRecord> updateAcademicRecord(String studentId, AcademicRecord record)
Future<List<Course>> getEnrolledCourses(String studentId)
```
- Manages academic performance data
- Tracks course enrollments
- Handles grade information
- Maintains academic history

#### Enrollment Management
```dart
Future<void> enrollInCourse(String studentId, String courseId)
Future<void> withdrawFromCourse(String studentId, String courseId)
Future<List<Enrollment>> getEnrollmentHistory(String studentId)
```
- Handles course enrollment
- Manages withdrawal requests
- Tracks enrollment history
- Validates enrollment eligibility

#### Student Search
```dart
Future<List<Student>> searchStudents(String query)
Future<List<Student>> getStudentsByProgram(String programId)
Future<List<Student>> getStudentsByYear(int year)
```
- Searches students by various criteria
- Filters by program and year
- Implements pagination
- Handles search parameters

## Error Handling
- Provides detailed error messages
- Handles database errors
- Manages validation failures
- Logs errors through LoggerService

## Security Considerations
- Implements role-based access control
- Validates student permissions
- Sanitizes student input
- Protects sensitive academic data

## Database Schema Compliance
- Follows Students table schema
- Maintains referential integrity with Users table
- Handles timestamps correctly
- Manages soft deletes
- Respects foreign key constraints

## Usage Example
```dart
final studentService = StudentServiceImpl();
try {
  final student = await studentService.getStudentById('student123');
  if (student != null) {
    await studentService.enrollInCourse('student123', 'course456');
    final academicRecord = await studentService.getAcademicRecord('student123');
    // Handle successful operations
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Handle error
}
```
